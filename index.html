        <a href="https://www.excellencecommunityschools.org">Excellence Community Schools</a>’ (ECS) Virtual Summer
        Immersive Program (VSIP) is an online program
        through which scholars select courses from a blend of content curated by
        ECS staff and some pre-built instruction offered by MIT and Harvard.
        Targeting our graduating 8th-grade scholars and other ECS alumni program
        participants through our students enrolled as first-year college
        students, the VSIP exposes students to the rigors of college academics.
        The program enhances the development of essential skills for whatever
        profession they choose. By the end of the experience and depending on
        their course selection, some scholars will take the certification
        examinations offered by MIT or Harvard.
