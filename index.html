        Excellence Community Schools’ (ECS) Virtual Summer Immersive Program
        (VSIP) is an online program through which scholars select courses from
        a blend of content curated by ECS staff and some pre-built instruction
        offered by MIT and Harvard. Targeting our graduating 8th-grade
        scholars and other ECS alumni program participants through our
        students enrolled as first-year college students, the VSIP exposes
        students to the rigors of college academics. The program enhances the
        development of essential skills for whatever profession they choose.
        By the end of the experience and depending on their course selection,
        some scholars will take the certification examinations offered by MIT
        or Harvard.

      scholars can experience instruction through innovative methods, achieve
      academic success remotely, and enjoy their summer.
